 *
 * Past auctions are read by scanning `AuctionCreated` + `AuctionEnded` events

 *
 * Caching: server-side `unstable_cache` with sensible revalidate windows.
 * Bigints are stringified at the cache boundary because Next's cache layer

 * All values are plain strings so the result is JSON-serializable for

 *
 * Caching is the load-bearing part: a settled/cancelled auction is *immutable*
 * (the contract deleted its storage; the only record is in logs that never
 * change), so we should derive it from an archive `eth_getLogs` scan exactly
 * once, not on a timer and never at build. Two mechanisms get us there:
 *   - `pastCount` (the number of storage-deleted auctions) is threaded in as
 *     an argument purely so it becomes part of the cache key. It increments
 *     exactly when a new auction settles or cancels — i.e. exactly when this
 *     blob needs to grow — so the cached value is reused untouched until then.
 *   - `revalidate` is a long 24h window rather than minutes: it's only a
 *     self-heal backstop (a scan can return partial data if an RPC window
 *     fails — see getLogsChunked — so we don't want to cache a gap forever),
 *     not the normal refresh trigger.
 * Net effect: zero archive scans at build, and at runtime a scan only when a
 * new past auction appears (or once a day to self-heal), instead of every 5m.
