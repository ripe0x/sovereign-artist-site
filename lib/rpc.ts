/**
 * RPC client + transport with public-RPC failover and dynamic
 * `getLogs` chunk sizing.
 *
 * The template ships with a curated chain of free public RPCs (chain 1)
 * so non-technical artists can deploy with no signup. Power users can set
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` (single) or `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URLS` (comma-sep'd
 * chain) to override — their URLs become the primary, public RPCs become
 * fallbacks beneath them.
 *
 * The block-range a given RPC will accept on `eth_getLogs` varies (Cloudflare
 * caps at ~1024, Alchemy/PublicNode/drpc allow much more). Rather than guess,
 * `getLogsChunked` adapts: it starts at a generous chunk size and shrinks
 * (with retry) when it sees the typical "block range too large" error.

// Curated public RPCs for chain 1, ordered by suitability for the read
// patterns this page actually uses (eth_call + archive eth_getLogs).
//
// The homepage enriches past (settled/cancelled) auctions by scanning the
// house's event history from its creation block forward. That is an *archive*
// getLogs query — it reads logs far older than the ~128 most recent blocks —
// and the bundled free RPCs have quietly stopped serving those for free:
//   - PublicNode now 403s archive getLogs ("Archive requests require a
//     personal token") — still fine for eth_call at `latest`, useless here.
//   - drpc free tier rejects ranges over 10k blocks.
//   - LlamaRPC has been intermittently 5xx-ing (Cloudflare 521).
//   - Cloudflare caps the range and errors generically on anything wider.
// With all four failing, viem retries + rotates across them per window and
// the build-time prerender of `/` blows past the host's 60s per-page budget.
//
// Tenderly's public gateway serves full-range archive getLogs (and eth_call)
// with no token and no signup — it answered the whole house scan in ~1.4s in
// testing — so it leads. The others stay on as fallbacks for eth_call and
// recent-log reads. Power users should still set NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL to their
// own archive endpoint; it slots in ahead of all of these (see getRpcUrls).
//
// 1. Tenderly gateway — archive getLogs + eth_call, no token. Primary.
// 2. PublicNode — fast eth_call / recent logs; archive getLogs token-gated.
// 3. drpc.org — eth_call + getLogs in <=10k windows (the chunker shrinks to fit).
// 4. LlamaRPC — additional fallback.
// 5. Cloudflare — last resort; narrow getLogs range so demoted.
